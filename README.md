# Text Mining University Project

 

Nowadays social networks became a pillar for social interaction and Microblogging is a new
form of communication in which users can describe their current status in short posts distributed by
instant messages, mobile phones, email or the Web. 

Long text classification is a classic task in natural language processing. This project aims to evaluate how well does the currenet classification techniques fit into **short text classification** also known as microblog classification.

To do so the [Twitter Political Corpus](http://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/nchamber/data/twitter/) data set is used. 
Given a tweet, the task is to distinguish political tweets from non-political ones. 

Machine learning algorithms used:
  * Na√Øve Bayes
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Maximum Entropy

**Keywords**: Python, Natural language Processing, NLTK, Machine Learning.
