In this study we have analyzed a large social network in a
new form of social media known as micro blogging. 
The work showed results for some classic classification techniques applied to short text classification.
These results reveal that Support Vector Machine has the best $F_1$-Measure but the Maximum entropy needs less features than the Support Vector Machine to get almost the same outcome. Moreover, the unigrams features are better for this kind of classification.
